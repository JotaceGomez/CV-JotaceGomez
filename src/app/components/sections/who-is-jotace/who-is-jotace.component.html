          Hello! üòä My name is
          <span class="custom-light-blue">Jos√© Carlos G√≥mez</span> and I'm a
          <span class="custom-light-blue"
            >Front-End Developer specialized in Angular</span
          >üë®‚Äçüíª <br /><br />

          I decided to dive into the world of programming after several years
          working in the digital marketing sector. I trained at the CodeHouse
          Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp with a specialization in .NET, where
          I gained skills in technologies like
          <span class="custom-light-blue"
            >HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, Javascript, TypeScript, Angular, MySQL,
            NodeJS, MongoDB, Express, and .NET.</span
          >
          <br /><br />
          My short-term goal is to continue expanding my knowledge and skills as
          a developer. Long-term, I aspire to be part of innovative and exciting
          projects, gaining the trust of a company to lead their best projects.
          <br /><br />
          My previous experience as a digital marketing technician and my
          passion for photography have introduced me to the world of graphic
          design, allowing me to handle creative tools like Adobe Photoshop,
          Lightroom, and GIMP.
          <br /><br />
          The three adjectives that best describe my ideal work environment are
          <span class="custom-light-blue">
            "organized, digital, and creative."</span
          >

          <br /><br />
          When I'm not working, I enjoy disconnecting with activities like
          hiking, having a beer in the sun, or indulging in my passion for
          cinema by watching movies and series in their original language, which
          has helped me improve my English since childhood.
          <br />
          <br />

          I consider myself an open-minded, responsible person with good
          communication skills. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about
          programming, work, or any other topic! üòä
